  Our project is a miniature farming simulation game inspired by Stardew Valley. 
  Players move around a two-dimensional grid, plant seeds on soil tiles, and harvest 
  rops as they reach maturity. Each crop type features distinct growth rates and buy/sell 
  prices, encouraging different economic strategies. 

  The player begins with a limited number of coins and can purchase additional seeds from 
  an in-world shop. As crops grow, mature, and are sold, the player expands their inventory 
  and overall wealth. The goal is to accumulate as many coins as possible before the game 
  timer expires.

  Movement and interaction use standard keyboard controls, with a dedicated action key that 
  adapts to the tile in front of the player, allowing them to open the shop, plant seeds, 
  or harvest fully grown crops. The result is a compact but flexible farming experience 
  that blends planning, exploration, and resource management.
